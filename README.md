# sqlalchemy-challenge
This is my solution to homework 10 for data bootcamp.

# Overview
In this activity I have done a climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii. To start, using Python and SQLAlchemy  on a Jupyter Notebook I did a exploration of the data based on the findings from differnt stations in Honolulu. From there, using the data I found I put it in Visual Studio Code to create a Climate App to present my findings. This app will also tell users the max, min, and avg temps base on a starting date or a starting through ending date.
